NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network reset_IBUF has no load.
WARNING:LIT:395 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 3
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   clk50_IBUF,
   enable_IBUF,
   u_d_IBUF
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <clk50_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <enable_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <u_d_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <reset_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:986 - The SAVE constraint for nets has been made more strict
   starting in 10.1, such that the net driver and load blocks will be preserved
   as well. To revert to the original behavior please set XIL_MAP_OLD_SAVE.
INFO:MapLib:984 - SAVE has been detected on the following signal(s):
   reset,
   clk50,
   enable,
   u_d.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

* Slices can be packed with basic elements from multiple hierarchies.
  Therefore, a slice will be counted in every hierarchical module
  that each of its packed basic elements belong to.
** For each column, there are two numbers reported <A>/<B>.
   <A> is the number of elements that belong to that specific hierarchical module.
   <B> is the total number of elements from that hierarchical module and any lower level
   hierarchical modules below.
*** The LUTRAM column counts all LUTs used as memory including RAM, ROM, and shift registers.
